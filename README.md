# Fraud_apps_detection_using_sentiment_analysis
This project aims to detect fraudulent mobile applications by analyzing user reviews from the Google Play Store. We utilize the Naive Bayes classifier, a probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem, which is well-suited for text classification tasks like sentiment analysis. By preprocessing the textual content, we train the Naive Bayes classifier to classify reviews into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. 
This methodology strikes a balance between performance and computational efficiency, making it effective for this application. Contributions are welcome!
